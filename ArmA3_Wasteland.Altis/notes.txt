NOTE: 
- Check the keys list for ArmA3 for the h key so we can holster for the keybinding rather than scrollwheel
- In the gun store menu for the PM pistol, the mags don't show up for them we might need to get some data values 
  for the ID of the ammo it takes then look for the file that we can edit to add the ammo to the store. (And put a price on it)
- Fix a lot of prices
- Thermals seem to be 'disabled', we need to enable them and place all the thermal stuff/optics into the stoers and set some really high prices for them
